# Timgr - The Public Release
Timgr is a Python-based desktop application designed to simplify employee timesheet management, ideal for small and large businesses alike. 
By processing data from fingerprint identification systems, Timgr transforms it into organized, readable, and information-rich reports. This significantly reduces the time HR professionals spend on timesheet processing, allowing them to complete in minutes what once took hours. 
By cutting processing time, Timgr empowers HR teams to focus on strategic initiatives, such as talent management and organizational development. 
The app also provides enhanced insights into employee shifts, using color-coded highlights to easily identify leaves, absences, holidays, and discrepancies. 
The user-friendly GUI was built using PySimpleGUI, ensuring an intuitive experience for users.
